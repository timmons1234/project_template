## Topic

The skill gap in Network Engineering

## Introduction

The field of Network Engineering, which encompasses roles of network administrators, network security specialists and network architects, is at a crossroad where current training approaches are failing to meet industry needs.  The failure is not only at the Subject Matter Expert (SME) level but also includes auditors, trainers and consultants.  The issue at hand is more than just training a few more individuals to the SME level but goes deeper into how network engineers are trained from the entry to expert level. There is a need for a better way to train new employees, a better way to educate the majority in the industry to raise the overall skill level, and a better way to educate at institutions of higher education. Some questions to be asked are: How can companies train newly hired employees (whether they have just graduated from college or are new to the fields) up to qualified levels where they can make a contribution? How can these new members be elevated to higher levels? What is a realistic time frame for this to occur?

This paper will delve into reasons for this skill gap in the network engineering field, current training paradigms for network engineering students, ways that this training can be improved with Modeling and Simulation techniques and will provide an example of a new networking technology and how M&S techniques could be implemented in this training.

Reasons for the Skill Gap

The Skill Gap for the Network Engineering field has been influenced by the contracting culture that has taken over many industries. The contracting culture referenced refers to companies hiring SMEs on a project by project basis due in part to the high salaries that SMEs demand and not taking a yearly payroll hit if they were full time employees. When contracting like this occurs there is little to no knowledge transfer from these experts to company personnel.  Businesses expect employees to rise to the skill level of these SMEs but there is not the proper training for this to occur as the current training is lacking for maintaining and improving skills in network engineering.
 
Current training

Current training practices revolve around the higher education setting where universities and similar institutions are tasked with providing marketable skill sets to students for entering their desired industry after degree completion. However, this brings up the question of what skills should a newly graduated student possess when entering the workforce? Whose job is it to train a new employee? What is the best way to train someone on the skills needed for Network and Security Engineering?
The questions of whose job it is to train an employee and what skill set they should have when entering the workplace has been the focus of many previous studies. These studies try to determine what skill sets companies look for in recent graduates, what skills are taught at the university level and if there is disconnect between what companies want/expect of new graduates and what skills these new graduates show up with.

The literature tends to show a mismatch between the skills companies expect future employees to have and the specific skills being taught at universities. A commonality found among the paper is that many companies value what Andres and Higson (2008) called “Soft Skills”, which are discipline agnostic skills. Examples of these soft skills included areas such as communication (both verbal and written), ability to give presentations, teamwork and leadership. (Andrews and Higson,2008; Bridgstock, 2009; Markes, 2006; Nair, Paril and Mertova, 2009; Saunders and Zuzel, 2010). This finding is in contrast to the belief of many graduating students who thought discipline specific skills would be more valued (Saunder and Zuzel, 2010). (Add more to this section on how students are trained, i.e. just reading a book and taking a test etc.)

The mismatch between industry and higher education has not gone noticed and there are efforts in place to try to bridge this gap. At the University of South Florida, a Systems Engineering approach to course creation was implemented that has an emphasis on industry feedback for course curriculum (Adithya, Pandey, Caballero, Yurur & Moreno, 2018). (Add more to this section if can find information)
Institutions of higher education are trying to implement change to more align their curriculum with industry but is this necessarily the best way or place to train the technical skills associated with Network Engineering. Outside of the university setting, training for network engineering is very similar to traditional classroom learning used at Universities. Programs, such as the certifications provided by Cisco, are structured with predefined lessons to teach basic generic technical skills over a period of months but nothing that is tailored to a particular company or application (Arslan, Yuksel & Gunes, 2015). Companies need network administrators whose skills are tailored to their particular network setup and cybersecurity posture and who are highly skilled at maintaining the network and cybersecurity infrastructure.

To facilitate this dynamic environment, new training methods that are equally dynamic need to be employed and the use of Modeling and Simulation based techniques can fill this training need.  M&S can be used to customize a training program to a company’s specific architecture, to the skills that a company wants to promote and can be made to accommodate the learning style of the trainee.  This helps to create tools that are easy to use and help promote knowledge transfer to increase personnel skill levels (Adithya et al., 2018; Lathrop, Trent & Hoffman, 2016).
 
M&S for Training

Simulation based techniques allows teaching methods to branch away from tradition using methods described by Jing and Qi (2015) as Case Teaching.  In traditional teaching the “main teaching modes are “teacher talking” and “students listening” while case teaching is focused on “training students' ability to utilize knowledge to solve practical problems” (Jing and Qi, 2015). To extend Case teaching to networking training is to necessitate a training medium that can be altered for different scenarios and potentially be able to mimic a company’s network infrastructure. One of the facets for the Case study to work the examples provided to the students must be based on real examples and the examples should be practical not theoretical (Jing and Qi, 2015).

A review of the literature shows that there are two paths that are being taken in creating simulation based training: gamification virtual environments. The term gamification refers to using mechanics of games ( such as a ranking system or reward system (Zielke et al., 2015) in tasks that are not game related to make “work and learning more engaging and fun” (Babcock, 2017). Gamification has been shown to enhance learning and motivation and “fosters active learning by providing them a bonus for every hindrance they overcome” (Adithya et al., 2018). Virtual environments are those created in a computer that mimic reality and vary in terms of fidelity depending on the need. Another benefit of gamification and virtualization is that this training can be implemented to provide a stepped type of problem solving where difficultly can be gradually increased, certain scenarios can be developed as part of a training program and they can be implemented on a user’s computer for self-paced learning ((This may need some references if kept).

In the area of virtual environments for training/teaching networking principles work has been done by many groups. Sousa et al, (2003) created a virtual laboratory environment, accessible through the internet, for training the networking principle of Quality of Service (QoS) that proved successful enough to put into the curriculum at the University of Brasilia in Brazil. Martinez et al, (2013) created the VNUML (Virtual Network User Mode) UM Virtualization Tool to teach the advanced to teach the advanced concepts of “mobility, load balancing or high availability” as well as more basic concepts of “network configuration” and “network routing” (Ruiz-Martinez et al, 2013). VNUML-UM is a program designed to run virtual networks, that can be configured based on the principles to be taught and allow students interaction through entering commands to change network parameters (Ruiz Martinez et al.). The authors found that students were able to “understand some concepts that initially were too abstract for them” after using the VNUML-UM tool as a teaching aid (Ruiz-Martinez et al, 2013).

In the literature some authors have made a distinction between gamification and what Serious/Educational Game (Babock; Zielke, et al), however for the purpose here they refer to the same thing.

In the area of gamification/Educational Game, pioneering work has been done by the Aslan et al, when the “Network Management Game (NMG)” was created to train network administrators. The basis for NMG was other simulation based games such as flight simulators and the games goal was to “maximize the network's throughput by manipulation link weights” (Aslan et al, 2013). Results showed that training on the system helped to improve a player’s ability to optimize a network through the manipulation of link weights. While not networking based, other areas have also benefited from gamification/education game to include a nursing/physician game to help improve communication skills (Zielke, et al, 2015) and a board game to teach help desk troubleshooting skills (Babcock, 2017). These show that learning through gaming is viable option for teaching new skills and one that is capable of being used as a form of training in the field of network engineering.
 
 
Future Network Technology Training Proposal
 
The use of virtual and game like environments, based on a review of the literature, have the ability to improve networking skills with the proper implementation. (May want to move this sentence elsewhere, not sure its needed here)
 
The field of Network Engineering is one of constant change as new technologies are brought online that were designed to create better data flow and prevent network congestion and lost data. One such technologies is Software Defined Networking (SDN) and while the benefits of this technology are many the downside is that need to train the current and future workforce on this technology.
(Add more information on SDN and sources)

SDN is a technology ready for training in the virtual/educational environment and a game or virtual environment is proposed for use to train this technology. The actual implementation is left for future research but a few key areas will be stated that need to be kept in mind when designing this game.

What is the training objective?

How will the training be accessed (internet, stand alone game etc)?
(Add more from that one UCF Paper)
 
Conclusion

The field of Network Engineering is in need of new ways to train current and future practitioners to be able to maintain skill levels, increase skills levels and train on new technologies. Current classroom based teacher centered training with limited interaction by students does not lend itself to the changing networking field and is why simulation based techniques have been proposed. Through the use of virtual environments or gamification a training system that allows custom scenarios to be developed, instructor defined difficulty and training in a risk free space can be created to allow for more immersive and retentive training. SDN is a new networking technology that would benefit from training in a virtual/educational game environment. Care must be taken when creating these education games to ensure the game aspect does not outweigh the knowledge transfer but when correctly gaming can provide a novel way to learn material that is more engaging and even fun than traditional training.


## Research Questions

Why is there a skill gap?

How do we train new engineers? How do we increase the skill level of current engineers?

How do we create an environment that strengthens new candidates prior to entering the workforce?


## Research Method

Review the existing research and examine the current market

Review off the shelf software and simulators as viable training material

Examine future technologies as solutions to bridge the skill gap


## Hypotheses

There is a mismatch between the skills needed in the workplace and the skills taught to workforce candidates (i.e. students, those changing careers etc.)

Purpose driven curriculum allows engineers in the workforce to maintain and improve their skills

The implementation of future network technologies (i.e. SDN) changes the skills needed in the Network Engineering workforce.
