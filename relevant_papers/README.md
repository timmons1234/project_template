## Review

#### Paper 1
Title: Training network administrators in a game-like environment
Authors: Engin Arslan, Murat Yuksel, Mehmet Hadi Gunes (2015)

#### Summary:
The focus of this paper was the presentation of a novel way to train network administrations through a game like environment called the “Network Management Game (NMG)”. The reason for the investigation into a new form of training for Network administrators was that traditional training methods, such as Cisco Certifications, take months and do not allow for training custom skills related to a particular network or configuration. Another benefit of this type of training mentioned by the authors is that “simulations serve to compress and speed up the learning experience at a fraction of cost and risk”.  The experimental setup used to test knowledge transfer was to test two scenarios: Training without Mastery (players had a certain amount of time to complete level and once time ran out they were moved to the next) and Training with Mastery (players had to reach a certain score before they could move on). Results showed that training on the system helped to improve a player’s ability to optimize a network through the manipulation of link weights. 

#### Executive Summary:  
Arslan et. al present a well written paper on their implementation of a game to teach the network administration of maximizing a network's throughput.  The experimental setup section could have been explained a little clearer but would still allow the experiments to be reproduced based on the informaiton provided.  Overall a this article presents a good foundational work for this project.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in a manner that was not overly burdened with jargon and most were explained. The authors also provided graphcis (pictures, graphs, drawings) to help further explain points.  One shortcoming I saw was that some technical acronyms were never explained such as SNMP, MPLS and IPTV.  ANother was that the experiment section got a little confusing with how the second setup was ran.

#### Reproducibility
With access to the NMG and training on how to create scenarios in this program the experiments done by Arslan et al. could be reproduced.  The authors go into detail explaining how each experiment was ran and what metrics were used.

#### Rating
3.5

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3.5 because overall it was a good paper that was relevant to our topic but it did get a little confusing during the parts but was a good read on how this type of gamification of network training was implemented.



#### Paper 2
Title: Applying Human Factors Research Towards Cyberspace Operations: A Practitioner's Perspective 
Authors: Scott D. Lathrop, Stoney Trent, Robert Hoffman (2016)


#### Summary:
The focus of the article is on improvements that can be made to the cyberspace domain by applying Human Factors Research.  The authors briefly desribe the Cyberspace Mission from the Cyberspace Command perspective and what the responsibilites of the three Cyber Mission Force teams (Cyber Protection Team, Cyber Mission Team and Cybe Support Team).  A brief explanation is provided on the problem of training junior personnel.  The authors then provide their 3 recommendations for improvement of the training and cybertoosl available for use by the Cyber Command.  The recommendations invovle the creation of labs that mimic the fog of war in the cyber domain, improving measures and metrics for design requirements and realistic testing environments.

#### Executive Summary:  
Lathrop et al provides an article that allows a reader to get a basic overview of the Cyber domain while not getting bogged down into too many details.  Unfortunatly the article gets a little too self invovled when trying to make sure the reader knows that cyberspace is not cybersecurity.  While the recommendations provided have merit, recommendations are not given for how to actually begin to implement them which becomes a shortcoming of the article.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in a manner that was not overly burdened with jargon and concepts were explained.  The writing would not cause a reader to get lost in explanations and the few graphics provided were used effectively.

#### Reproducibility
Experiments were not performed for this paper as it was a exposition about how to improve Cyber training and tools based on the authors' expertise in the topic.

#### Rating
3

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3 because it was written in an easy to read way but at times got bogged down in trying to repeatedly make sure that the reader knew Cyberspace was not Cybersecurity.  It provided a sound but brief oveview of Cyberspace in a way that a lay person could undeerstand.  It also provided an article demonstrating another area where there is a need for adaptable and flexible training that can meet the demands of a changing field.
