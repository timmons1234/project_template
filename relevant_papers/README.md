## Review

#### Paper 1

> * Title: Training network administrators in a game-like environment
> * Authors: Engin Arslan, Murat Yuksel, Mehmet Hadi Gunes (2015)

#### Summary:
The focus of this paper was the presentation of a novel way to train network administrations through a game like environment called the “Network Management Game (NMG)”. The reason for the investigation into a new form of training for Network administrators was that traditional training methods, such as Cisco Certifications, take months and do not allow for training custom skills related to a particular network or configuration. Another benefit of this type of training mentioned by the authors is that “simulations serve to compress and speed up the learning experience at a fraction of cost and risk”.  The experimental setup used to test knowledge transfer was to test two scenarios: Training without Mastery (players had a certain amount of time to complete level and once time ran out they were moved to the next) and Training with Mastery (players had to reach a certain score before they could move on). Results showed that training on the system helped to improve a player’s ability to optimize a network through the manipulation of link weights. 

#### Executive Summary:  
Arslan et. al present a well written paper on their implementation of a game-like experience to teach the network administration task of maximizing a network's throughput.  The experimental setup section provides explanations of how the setup was tested to determine the level of knowledge but this section could have been explained a little clearer but would still allow the experiments to be reproduced based on the informaiton provided.  Overall a this article will be useful as a solid foundational work for this project.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in a manner that was not overly burdened with jargon and when jargon was used it was explained. The authors also provided graphics (pictures, graphs, drawings) to help further explain different aspects such as examples of network topologies and testing scores.  Shortcomings were that some technical acronyms (SNMP, MPLS, IPTV) were never explained and that the experiment section got a little confusing when setup of the second round of experimentation was described.

#### Reproducibility
With access to the NMG program and training on how to create scenarios the experiments done by Arslan et al. could be reproduced.  The authors go into detail explaining how each experiment was ran and what metrics were used.

#### Rating
3.5

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3.5 because overall it was a good paper that was relevant to our topic and provided a method that could be used ot bring up the skill level of the industry.  However, it did get a little confusing during some parts but was a good read on how this type of gamification of network training was implemented and the positive results seen.




#### Paper 2
> * Title: Applying Human Factors Research Towards Cyberspace Operations: A Practitioner's Perspective 
> * Authors: Scott D. Lathrop, Stoney Trent, Robert Hoffman (2016)


#### Summary:
The focus of the article is on improvements that can be made to the cyberspace domain by applying Human Factors Research.  The authors briefly desribe the Cyberspace Mission from the Cyberspace Command perspective and what are the responsibilites of the three Cyber Mission Force teams (Cyber Protection Team, Cyber Mission Team and Cybe Support Team). A brief background is given on some of the causes for the lack of a depth of knowledge in the industry and a lack of proper tools to be used. The authors then provide their 3 recommendations for improvement of the training and cybertools available for use by the Cyber Command.  The recommendations invovle the creation of labs that mimic the fog of war in the cyber domain, improving measures and metrics for design requirements and realistic testing environments.

#### Executive Summary:  
Lathrop et al. provides an article that allows a reader to get a basic overview of the Cyber domain while not getting bogged down into too many details.  Unfortunatly the article gets a little too self invovled when trying to make sure the reader knows that cyberspace is not cybersecurity as this is repeated several times.  While the recommendations provided have merit and coudl help to make improvements the authors chose not to provide recommendations how to begin to implement the change but instead leave this to future research.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in a manner that was not overly burdened with jargon and concepts were adequatly explained.  The writing would not cause a reader to get lost in explanations and the few graphics provided were used effectively.

#### Reproducibility
Experiments were not performed for this paper as it was a exposition about how to improve Cyber training and tools based on the authors' expertise in the topic.

#### Rating
3

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3 because it was written in an easy to read way but at times got bogged down in trying to repeatedly make sure that the reader knew Cyberspace was not Cybersecurity.  It provided a sound but brief oveview of Cyberspace in a way that a lay person could undeerstand.  It also provided an article demonstrating another area where there is a need for adaptable and flexible training that can meet the demands of a changing field.



#### Paper 3
> * Title: Teaching Advanced Concepts in Computer Networks: VNUML-UM Virtualization Tool
> * Authors: Antonio Ruiz-Martinez, Fernando Pereniguez-Garcia, Rafael Marin Lopez, Pedro M. Ruiz Martinez, Antoni F. Skarmeta-Gomez


#### Summary:
The purpose of this paper was to detail a study performed by the authors where they showed that the VNUML-UM (Virtual Network User Mode) Virtualization Tool helped students learn basic network concepts such as network configuration and network routing and advanced concepts such as mobility, load balancing and high availability.  Background is provided where the authors describe current practices where physical labs with physically connected computers were needed to teach students networking and how this was not an effective use of time due to the limited number of students who could learn on the setup at one time.  The VNUML program remediates this by allowing it to be installed on a student’s personal computer where it has the ability to run virtual networks that can be configured in any scenario depending on the lesson to be taught and the student can interact by running commands to change network parameters.  The authors also state the software has the ability to be used in professional environments for network design.

#### Executive Summary:  
Ruiz-Martinez et al. provides a article on how the VNUML-UM tool can be used to more efficiently train studnets in basic and advanced networking concepts and how this tool can even be extended for use in the professional environment.  The paper then describes benefits of the tool (such as being able to be installed on a student's personal computer) and then describe the testing performed to show performance improvement.  This article will be another good basis for using simulation tools for network training.

#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in an easy to read manner and concepts were adequatly explained.  The one issue with the paper was that the experiment section detailing differnet student population years could have been written more clearly to allow for better comparison of the methods.

#### Reproducibility
The authors describe the testing performed and with training on how to use hteystem the testing could be repeated.

#### Rating
3.5

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3.5 because overall it was a good paper that was relevant to our topic and provided a method that could be used ot bring up the skill level of the industry.  However, it did get a little confusing during some parts but was a good read on how this type of virutalization tool could be implemented for network training and the positive results seen.



#### Paper 4
> * Title: A review of literature on employability skill needs in engineering
> * Author: Imren Markes


#### Summary:
The purpose of this paper was provide information on a skill gap in engineering positions in the UK and a lack of employability of engineering students due to current (as of 2006) institutional academics. A main point of the article was that earing a degree, which is a traditional marker for showing disciplien specific skilsl, was not as important to employers as “transferable skills  and experience”.  The author also states that “the training needs of industry and commerce are not being met by colleges as few colleges conduct surveys of local business needs and little attention is paid to skill gaps in the national economy”.  The author posits that more collaboration is needed between academia and industry to create curriculum and teach skills that are more important to employers than just the discipline specific skills that are currently focused upon (well as of the writing of the article).

#### Executive Summary:  

Markes provides a paper with the overarching theme that more collaboration is needed between academia and industry to create curriculum and teach skills that are more important to employers than the discipline specific skills that are currently focused upon at the university level.


#### Clarity of Exposition
The paper was written in a manner that was not overly burdened with jargon and when jargon was used it was explained  The one issue with the paper was that the amount of tables placed in the article took away from the flow while reading and could make a reader lose the points being made.

#### Reproducibility
Experiments were not performed for this paper as it was a exposition about the difference in the skills taught at a university and those desired by employers.

#### Rating
3.0

#### Explanation of Rating
I gave the article a 3.0 because overall it was a good paper that was relevant to our topic and provided background into causes for skill gaps in engineering that can be applied to Network Engineering.
